## 🤝 How to Contribute

### 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following:

-   ✅ A [GitHub](https://github.com) account (sign up if you don't have one)

### 🚀 Steps to Contribute

Follow these steps even if it’s your **first time contributing to open source**:

---

#### 1. **Fork the Repository**

This creates a **copy** of the project in your GitHub account.

-   Go to the top right of this page and click the `Fork` button.
-   GitHub will make a copy under your username.

---

#### 2. **Clone Your Fork to Your Computer**

This downloads your copy of the project so you can edit it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BugBuster.git
cd BugBuster/
```

> 🔁 Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

---

#### 3. **Create a New Branch**

A branch is like a workspace to safely make changes.

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

> 📝 Tip: Name your branch based on what you're working on, e.g., `fix-login-bug` or `add-footer`.

---

#### 4. **Make Your Changes**

Open the project in your code editor and:

-   Write code
-   Add features or fix bugs
-   Improve styling or layout
-   Update documentation

> 🧪 Make sure everything works as expected before continuing.

---

#### 5. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**

Git tracks file changes in two steps:

-   **Stage** files you want to include:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

-   **Commit** them with a message:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "commit message"
    ```

> 💬 Commit messages should include the brief text description that explains the changes made in a specific commit

---

#### 6. **Push Your Changes to GitHub**

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

This uploads your changes from your computer to your GitHub fork.

---

#### 7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**

A Pull Request lets us know you want to merge your changes into the main project.

-   Go to your fork on GitHub
-   Switch from main branch to the branch you created
-   Click **Compare & pull request**
-   Write a short title and description
-   Submit the pull request!

Once submitted, project maintainers will review your code and may leave suggestions or approve it to be merged 🚀

### ✅ Contribution Guidelines

To maintain code quality and collaboration:

-   Use meaningful commit messages
-   Make sure your code works and is tested
-   Don’t commit directly to the `main` branch
-   Respect the feedback during code reviews
-   Be kind and constructive—everyone’s learning here
